# Golf: Full Pyramid

## Development Progression

*Two algorithms were used. (A naive third solution was clearly infeasible to me, so I didn't even bother to implement that.) In general, you can consider development to have moved from larger sizes to smaller sizes, though I'll try to note down any irregularities here.*

* `golffullpyramid-MLExploit-alg1-106-alt1.c` was derived from `golffullpyramid-MLExploit-alg1-103.c` when I was looking for useful transformations of the code.
	* `golffullpyramid-MLExploit-alg1-103-alt1.c` was then derived from `golffullpyramid-MLExploit-alg1-106-alt1.c`
